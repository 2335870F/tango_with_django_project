<!--Within the body of the HTML page there is a <form> element. Look at the attributes for it. All data captured within this form is sent to the URL /rango/add_category/ as a HTTP POST request (the method attribute is case insentitive so u can do POST or post. ) One loop controls hidden form fields, the other visible form fields. The visible fields to the user are controlled by the fields atribute within your ModelForm Meta class. These loops produce HTML markup for each form element. For visible form fields, we add in any errors that may be present with a particular field and help text that can be used to explain to the user what they need to enter.
    #Hidden HTML form fields were created which allow web applications to pass important info to a client (which cannot be seen on the rendered page) in a HTML form, only to be sent back to the originating server when the user submits the form
    crsf_token is a cross-site request forgery token, which helps to protect and secure the HTTP POST action that is initiated on the subsequent submission of a form. The Django framework requires the CRSF token to be present. If you forget to include the token in ur forms, a user may encounter errors when they submit the form.-->
